# \<basic-demo\>

Basic demo coupling two instances of `iron-list` and a filter together.

Loads country and flag information in and ties together.

Uses virtualised listing and attempts to mitigate the repeated image loading.

*TODO selection persistence*

This is just to experiment with iron-list.
